                <h5><b>LEARING SUGGESTIONS</b><br><br>
                    1. Try to connect different types of computer models and understand
                    the improvements with the advantages and disadvantages.<br><br>
                    2. Do more practices to proficient data storage methods and combine
                    mind maps to distinguish the relationship between different storage
                    methods.<br><br>
                    3. This Section will have many new concepts, making sure you
                    understand and get familiar to the definitions and relations between the
                    new phrases.<br><br>
                    4. In this section we will give a more general view about the
                    structural evolution and data storage regarding computers,
                    hoping to give beginners a preliminary understanding.</h5>

                <h5><b>LEARING SUGGESTIONS</b><br><br>
                    1. This section has many key terms, making sure you are familiar with
                    them and understand their operating mechanism.<br><br>

                <h2>Software</h2>
                <h5><b>LEARING SUGGESTIONS</b><br><br>
                    1. A computer is system made of two major components: hardware and
                    software. <br><br>2. Computer hardware is the physical equipment, which has been
                    studied before. Now as for the software, it is the collection of programs
                    that allows the hardware to do its job. Instead of just being known as
                    some programs operating in the computer, software contains many parts,
                    dividing into two broad categories: operating system and application
                    program. <br><br>3. In this section, we will have a systematic learning of the
                    framework of the system and its elements.</h5>

                <h2>Data</h2>
                <h5><b>LEARING SUGGESTIONS</b><br><br>
                    1. In this chapter, we delve into the fascinating world of databases and
                    database management systems (DBMS). <br><br>2. We introduce the concept of the
                    three-level architecture for a DBMS, with a primary focus on the
                    relational database model. Real-world examples illustrate the operational
                    aspects of this model. <br><br>3. Furthermore, we explore the Standard Query
                    Language (SQL) as a vital tool for manipulating data in relational databases.
                    We touch briefly on the database design process and conclude with a
                    glance at other existing database models.</h5>

            <div class="chapter">
                <h2>Network</h2>
                <h5><b>LEARING SUGGESTIONS</b><br><br>
                    1. While the primary aim of this chapter is to explore
                    the Internet, a global system that links billions of
                    computers, it's vital to consider the Internet not as a
                    solitary network but as an intricate web of
                    interconnected networks. <br><br>2. With this perspective in
                    mind, we commence our journey by first defining what
                    constitutes a network. Subsequently, we delve into the
                    methods of interconnecting these networks, forging
                    compact internetworks. <br><br>3. Finally, we unveil the intricate
                    structure of the Internet, setting the stage for in depth exploration in the remainder of this
                    chapter.</h5>

                <h2>Big Data</h2>
                <h5><b>LEARING SUGGESTIONS</b><br><br>
                    1. Big data primarily refers to data sets that are too large or complex to
                    be dealt with by traditional data-processing application software. <br><br>2. Big data analysis
                    include capturing data, data storage, data analysis,
                    search, sharing, transfer, visualization, querying, updating, information
                    privacy, and data source.<br><br>3. Big data was originally associated with three key concepts:
                    volume,
                    variety, and velocity.</h5>
