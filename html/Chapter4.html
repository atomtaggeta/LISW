            <h1>Learning Suggestions</h1>  
            <p>In this chapter, we delve into the fascinating world of databases and database management systems (DBMS). We introduce the concept of the three-level architecture for a DBMS, with a primary focus on the relational database model. Real-world examples illustrate the operational aspects of this model. Furthermore, we explore the Standard Query Language (SQL) as a vital tool for manipulating data in relational databases. We touch briefly on the database design process and conclude with a glance at other existing database models.</p>

        <div class="content-section" id="data-structure">  
            <h1>Data Structure</h1>  
            <p>A data structure uses a collection of related variables that can be accessed individually or as a whole. In other words, a data structure represents a set of items with a specific relationship between them.</p>  
        
            <h2>Arrays</h2>  
            <p>An array is a fixed-size, sequenced collection of elements of the same data type. The elements of the array are individually addressed through their subscripts. Loops make array processing easy.</p>  
            <h3>Array Applications:</h3>  
            <ul>  
                <li>Frequency Arrays</li>  
                <img src="../img/Chapter4-1.png" alt="图片描述" width="350" height="200">
                <li>Histograms</li>  
                <img src="../img/Chapter4-2.png" alt="图片描述" width="250" height="300">
                <li>Two-dimensional arrays</li>  
                <img src="../img/Chapter4-3.png" alt="图片描述" width="350" height="500">
                <li>Memory layout</li>  
            </ul>  
    
            <h2>Records</h2>  
            <p>A record is a collection of related elements, possibly of different types, having a single name. Each element in a record is called a field. A field is the smallest element of named data that has meaning. Since each field in a record has a name, we could simply use the name. Many programming languages use a period to separate the record name from the field name.</p>  
            <img src="../img/Chapter4-5.png" alt="图片描述" width="300" height="180">
            <h2>Linked Lists</h2>  
            <p>A linked list is an ordered collection of data in which each element contains the location of the next element; that is, each element (node) contains data and a link. The link contains a pointer (an address) that identifies the next element in the list. The link in the last element contains a null pointer, indicating the end of the list.</p>  
    
            <h3>Nodes</h3>  
            <p>A node in a linked list is a record that has at least two fields. The nodes in a linked list are called self-referential records.</p>  
    
            <h3>Pointers to Linked Lists</h3>  
            <p>A linked list must always have a head pointer.</p>  
    
            <h3>Operations on Linked Lists:</h3>  
            <ul>  
                <li>Inserting a node</li>  
                <li>Deleting a node</li>  
                <li>Searching a list</li>  
                <li>Retrieving a node</li>  
                <li>Traversing a list</li>

        <div class="content-section" id="abstract-data-types">  
            <h1>Abstract Data Types (ADTs)</h1>  
            <p>In data processing, we need to define data as a package including the operations defined for the package. We need to write codes that can be used for all programmers. With an ADT, users are not concerned with how the task is done but rather with what it can do. It allows programmers to use functions while hiding the implementation. We abstract the essence of the process and leave the implementation details hidden.</p>

            <h2>Linear Lists</h2>  
            <p>A linear list is a list in which each element has a unique successor. Linear lists are used in situations where the elements are accessed randomly.</p>  
            <img src="../img/Chapter4-8.png" alt="图片描述" width="400" height="280">
            <h2>Stacks</h2>  
            <p>A stack is a restricted linear list in which all additions and deletions are made at one end, called the top. It is used for reversing data and backtracking.</p>  
            <img src="../img/Chapter4-9.png" alt="图片描述" width="300" height="230">
            <h2>Queues</h2>  
            <p>A queue is a linear list in which data can only be inserted at one end, called the rear, and deleted from the other end, called the front.</p>  
            <img src="../img/Chapter4-10.png" alt="图片描述" width="300" height="120">
            <h2>Trees</h2>  
            <p>Terms related to trees include nodes, branches, root, leaf, internal node, parent, child, siblings, ancestor, descendant, path, level, height, and subtrees.</p>  
            <img src="../img/Chapter4-11.png" alt="图片描述" width="350" height="280">
            <h2>Binary Trees</h2>  
            <p>A binary tree is a tree in which no node can have more than two subtrees. The structure is referred to as operand-operator-operand.</p>  
            <img src="../img/Chapter4-12.png" alt="图片描述" width="400" height="300">
            <h2>Graphs</h2>  
            <p>A graph is a collection of nodes, called vertices (or vertex), and a collection of line segments, called edges, connecting pairs of vertices.</p>

            <h1>Databases</h1>  
    
            <h2>1. Introduction</h2>  
            <p>Traditionally, data storage relied on individual, unrelated files, often referred to as flat files. In this outdated system, each application program within an organization had its own set of files. For example, within a university, different departments maintained their own files: the record office had a file for student information and grades, the financial aid office managed files for students needing financial assistance, the scheduling office kept records of professors and the courses they taught, and the payroll department stored information about all staff, including professors. Nowadays, all these disparate flat files can be unified into a single entity known as the database for the entire university.</p>  
    
            <h2>2. Definition of a Database</h2>  
            <p>While it's challenging to provide a universally accepted definition for a database, a common one is as follows:</p>  
            <ul>  
                <li><strong>Database:</strong> A database is a collection of related, logically coherent data used by the application programs in an organization.</li>  
            </ul>  
    
            <h2>3. Advantages of Databases</h2>  
            <p>Compared to flat-file systems, databases offer several advantages:</p>  
            <ul>  
                <li><strong>Less Redundancy:</strong> Flat-file systems often have redundant data, with the same information stored in multiple files. Databases reduce this redundancy, making data storage more efficient.</li>  
                <li><strong>Inconsistency Avoidance:</strong> When data is duplicated in multiple places, changes must be made consistently across all locations. Databases centralize data, reducing the chances of inconsistency.</li>  
                <li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> Databases are usually more efficient as data is stored in fewer places, allowing for faster data access.</li>  
                <li><strong>Data Integrity:</strong> Maintaining data integrity is easier in a database system since data is stored in fewer locations.</li>  
                <li><strong>Confidentiality:</strong> Centralized data storage in a database makes it easier to maintain information confidentiality.</li>  
            </ul>  
    
            <h2>4. Database Management System (DBMS)</h2>  
            <p>A Database Management System (DBMS) is responsible for defining, creating, and maintaining a database. It also controls access to the data within the database. A DBMS is composed of five components:</p>  
            <img src="../img/Chapter4-14.png" alt="图片描述" width="500" height="150">
            <ul>  
                <li><strong>Hardware:</strong> This includes the physical infrastructure like terminals, hard disks, main computers, and workstations that provide access to data.</li>  
                <li><strong>Software:</strong> The software consists of programs that allow users to access, maintain, and update data. It also manages user access rights to specific parts of the database.</li>  
                <li><strong>Data:</strong> Data in a database is physically stored on storage devices. The separation of data from the software accessing it allows for changes in the software without affecting the data's physical storage.</li>  
                <li><strong>Users:</strong> Users in a DBMS can be divided into two categories: end users and application programs. Database administrators (DBAs) and normal users are end users, with DBAs having higher privileges.</li>  
                <li><strong>Procedures:</strong> The DBMS relies on a set of procedures and rules that guide the users of the database.</li>
